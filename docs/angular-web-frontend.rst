======================
 Angular Web Frontend
======================

We are using Angular to build a web front-end. It was created with the
Angular CLI, following the `quickstart
<https://angular.io/guide/quickstart>`_::

  ng new web

Disclaimer: I'm pretty new to NG, having taken one class on it, and
witten one prototype... a year ago :-(.  I chose Angular as it seems
more "batteries included" than React, and Vue looked a bit too new.
