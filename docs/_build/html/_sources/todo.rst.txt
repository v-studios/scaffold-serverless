* Add our source code directories to the coverage report (it does ``.`` now, which is useless)
* separate requirements-devel.rst
* Try and prevent pip from reinstalling everything on every run, figure out the dependecy detection
* accept form fields like: "curl --form filename=ALEX.JPG"; may have to do with a POST Lambda handler
